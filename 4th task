#Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number

# ask user to enter number
num = int(input("input number:"))

# create empty list for divisors

# get all the numbers from 1 to user input and divide them
# one by one to get all the answers and put them in list
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if num % i == 0:
        a.append(i)
