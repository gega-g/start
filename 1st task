## Practice Problem From https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html
## Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that
## tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

# this program asks user about their age and name
name = input("input your name:")
age = int(input("input your age:"))

# this program removes whitespaces from the str
name = name.strip()

# this program capitalizes user name
name = name.title()

# this program calculates their birth date
birth_date = 2023 - age

# this program calculates the year they will be 100 years old
last_age = birth_date + 100
answ = f"{name} you will be 100 years old in {last_age}"

# this program asks about number of copies that the program will return
duply = int(input("how many copies should I print?"))
duplycated_answ = (answ +"\n") * duply
print(duplycated_answ)
